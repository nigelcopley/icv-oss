# Isolation layers and the threat model

django-boundary enforces tenant isolation at two independent layers: the Django ORM and the PostgreSQL database. Neither layer is sufficient alone. Together they form defence in depth, where each layer catches the failures the other cannot see. This document explains what each layer does, the threats each one addresses, why you want both, and the role strict mode plays.

## The two layers

### ORM layer: TenantManager auto-filtering

Every tenant-scoped model gets a `TenantManager` as its default `objects` manager (wired up by `TenantMixin`, `TenantModel`, or `make_tenant_mixin()`). `TenantManager.get_queryset()` reads the active tenant from `TenantContext` and, when a tenant is set, transparently adds a `.filter(tenant=...)` clause to every query, using the model's configured FK field name.

The effect is that ordinary application code never has to remember to scope its queries. `Booking.objects.all()` returns only the active tenant's bookings, `Booking.objects.get(pk=...)` cannot reach another tenant's row, and `bulk_create`/`bulk_update` auto-populate or validate the tenant FK against the active context. Writes are covered too: `save()` auto-populates the FK from context when it is unset, and `bulk_update` raises `ValueError` if any object belongs to a different tenant.

The ORM layer is the primary, always-on isolation mechanism. It works on any database backend, including SQLite in tests, because it is pure Python query construction.

### Database layer: PostgreSQL Row Level Security

The database layer is built from the migration operations in `boundary.migrations_ops`: `EnableRLS`, `CreateTenantPolicy`, and `DropTenantPolicy`. `EnableRLS` runs `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` followed by `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` so the policy applies even to the table owner. `CreateTenantPolicy` installs two policies and a helper function:

- A `LEAKPROOF` SQL function, `boundary_current_tenant_id()`, that reads the current tenant from the PostgreSQL session variable `app.current_tenant_id` (configurable via `BOUNDARY_DB_SESSION_VAR`). It is declared `LEAKPROOF` so the query planner cannot use it to leak values from rows the caller should not see. The function detects whether the tenant primary key is a UUID or an integer and casts accordingly.
- `boundary_tenant_isolation`, a policy with both a `USING` clause (controls which rows are visible to `SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`) and a `WITH CHECK` clause (controls which rows `INSERT`/`UPDATE` may write). Both clauses require `tenant_id = boundary_current_tenant_id()`. The `WITH CHECK` clause is what blocks an attempt to insert a row for a different tenant, even in raw SQL.
- `boundary_admin_bypass`, a policy that grants full visibility when the session variable `app.boundary_admin` (configurable via `BOUNDARY_ADMIN_FLAG_VAR`) is set to `'true'`.

The session variables are set for you by `TenantContext`. When you set or enter a tenant scope, `TenantContext` issues `SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant_id', <pk>, true)` against the connection, scoped to the current transaction. So the same `TenantContext` that drives ORM filtering also drives RLS. See [`TenantContext`](../../README.md#context) and [Add RLS policies with migrations](../how-to/add-rls-policies-with-migrations.md).

## Why you want both

The two layers fail in different ways and protect against different mistakes. Running only one leaves a class of bugs uncovered.

### What the ORM layer catches that RLS misses

The ORM layer is ergonomic and database-agnostic. It auto-populates the tenant FK on writes, validates cross-tenant `bulk_update`, and produces clear Python exceptions when context is missing. RLS does none of this: RLS only ever filters or rejects rows, it never fills in a missing `tenant_id` for you, and its errors surface as raw database exceptions rather than `TenantNotSetError`. RLS also requires PostgreSQL, so in test suites and on other backends the ORM layer is the only isolation you have.

### What RLS catches that the ORM layer misses

The ORM layer protects you only as long as queries go through `TenantManager`. It is bypassed by:

- **Raw SQL.** `connection.cursor().execute("SELECT ... FROM bookings")`, `Model.objects.raw(...)`, and queries from reporting tools or analytics jobs never touch `TenantManager`.
- **The unscoped manager.** `Model.unscoped` (an `UnscopedManager`) deliberately returns all rows regardless of context. It is an escape hatch, and any code path that reaches for it loses ORM filtering.
- **Other ORMs, scripts, and direct connections.** Anything connecting to the database that is not your Django application code.

RLS sits below all of this. Because the policy lives in the database and is enforced with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, a non-superuser connection sees only rows matching the session variable, whatever tool issued the query. The RLS test suite demonstrates this: raw SQL counts return only the active tenant's rows, an empty tenant context returns zero rows, and a raw `INSERT` for the wrong tenant is rejected by the `WITH CHECK` clause.

In short: the ORM layer is broad and convenient but only covers code that goes through it; RLS is narrow in what it does (visibility and write checks) but covers everything that reaches the database.

## The threat model

The layers are designed against three concrete failure modes, in roughly increasing severity.

1. **Accidental cross-tenant leaks in application code.** A developer writes a query but forgets to scope it, or builds a related lookup that crosses tenants. This is the most common and most likely failure. The ORM layer handles it by making correct scoping the default: there is no unscoped query to forget, because `objects` is already filtered. Strict mode (below) hardens this further by refusing to run when no tenant is set, rather than silently returning everything.

2. **ORM bypass.** Code legitimately or carelessly steps outside the ORM: raw SQL, `raw()`, the `unscoped` manager, a management command that forgets to set context, a third-party library issuing its own queries. The ORM layer cannot help here because the query never reaches `TenantManager`. RLS is the backstop: as long as the connection runs as a non-superuser with policies in `FORCE` mode, those queries are still constrained to the active tenant's rows.

3. **Raw SQL and direct database access.** Reporting jobs, analytics pipelines, ad hoc psql sessions, or a compromised code path that constructs SQL directly. Only RLS protects against this, and only when the connecting role is not a superuser.

### Important limits of RLS

Be precise about what RLS does and does not protect, otherwise you will over-trust it.

- **Superusers and `BYPASSRLS` roles bypass RLS entirely**, even with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. The RLS enforcement tests deliberately connect as a separate non-superuser role (`icv_app`) for exactly this reason. If your Django application connects to PostgreSQL as a superuser, RLS provides no protection. Run your application as a least-privileged, non-superuser role.
- **RLS depends on the session variable being set correctly.** If `app.current_tenant_id` is empty, RLS returns zero rows; if it is set to the wrong tenant, RLS faithfully returns that tenant's rows. RLS enforces "show me rows matching this session variable", not "show me the right tenant". Correctness still depends on `TenantContext` setting the variable to the intended tenant.
- **The admin bypass policy is a deliberate hole.** Any connection that can set `app.boundary_admin` to `'true'` sees every tenant's rows. That capability must be guarded as carefully as superuser access. See [Cross-tenant admin operations](../how-to/cross-tenant-admin-operations.md).
- **RLS does not auto-populate or validate writes beyond the policy predicate.** It will reject an `INSERT` whose `tenant_id` violates `WITH CHECK`, but it will not fill in a missing value. That ergonomics belongs to the ORM layer.

## Strict mode's role

Strict mode (`BOUNDARY_STRICT_MODE`, default `True`) governs what the ORM layer does when a tenant-scoped query runs with no active tenant in context.

- **With strict mode on**, `TenantManager.get_queryset()` raises `TenantNotSetError` when no tenant is set. It also sends the `strict_mode_violation` signal first, so you can wire up alerting. The query never runs.
- **With strict mode off**, the same query returns an unfiltered queryset across all tenants.

Strict mode closes the most dangerous gap in the ORM layer: a query that runs before context is established. Without it, a forgotten `TenantContext` set, a missing middleware, or a Celery task that did not bootstrap context would silently return or operate on every tenant's data. With it, that same mistake fails loudly and immediately, surfacing the bug in development and tests rather than leaking data in production. This is why it defaults to on, and why turning it off raises the `boundary.W001` system check warning.

Strict mode does not replace RLS, and RLS does not replace strict mode. Strict mode is a fail-closed default for the ORM layer; RLS is enforcement for everything below the ORM. A query that bypasses the ORM also bypasses strict mode, which is precisely the case RLS is there to cover.

## Putting it together

The recommended posture is all three controls active:

- The ORM layer always on, via `TenantMixin`/`TenantModel`/`make_tenant_mixin()`, for ergonomic, default-correct scoping.
- Strict mode on, so missing-context bugs fail closed instead of leaking.
- RLS enabled on every tenant-scoped table, with the application connecting as a non-superuser role, so raw SQL, the `unscoped` manager, and any non-Django access are still constrained at the database.

Boundary surfaces gaps in this posture through system checks: `boundary.E006` flags a tenant-scoped table missing RLS, and `boundary.W001` flags strict mode being disabled. See the [System Checks](../../README.md#system-checks) section of the README.
