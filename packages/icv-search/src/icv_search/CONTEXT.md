# icv-search — Context

## Role
Pluggable search engine integration layer for Django. Manages search index lifecycle,
document indexing, query execution, search merchandising, click tracking, and search
intelligence through a backend abstraction modelled after Django's cache and email
backend pattern.

## Architecture Layer
Domain — Layer 2

## Key Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `SearchIndex` | Index configuration and sync state; maps a logical index name to backend settings |
| `IndexSyncLog` | Audit trail for index create/configure/delete operations against the backend |
| `SearchQueryLog` | Individual search query record; FK to `AUTH_USER_MODEL` (nullable) |
| `SearchQueryAggregate` | Daily rollup of query volume and zero-result counts per query string |
| `SearchClick` | Individual click-through event linking a query to a document position |
| `SearchClickAggregate` | Daily rollup of clicks per query/document pair |
| `MerchandisingRuleBase` | Abstract base for all merchandising rules; provides scheduling and query-matching fields |
| `QueryRedirect` | Routes matching queries to a destination URL instead of executing search |
| `QueryRewrite` | Transforms the query string and/or auto-applies filters before engine execution |
| `SearchPin` | Forces specific documents to fixed positions or excludes them from results |
| `BoostRule` | Adjusts result ranking based on document attributes and query context |
| `SearchBanner` | Attaches promotional content blocks to matching search queries |
| `ZeroResultFallback` | Defines recovery strategies when a query returns no results |

## Services
16 modules, 40+ exported functions: `search`, `documents`, `indexing`,
`merchandising`, `redirects`, `rewrites`, `pins`, `boosts`, `banners`,
`fallbacks`, `suggestions`, `click_tracking`, `analytics`, `intelligence`,
`preprocessing`, `discovery`.

All services are module-level functions, re-exported via `services/__init__.py`
with `__all__`.

## Dependencies
- `APP-001 icv-core` — optional; provides `BaseModel` (UUID PK + timestamps). When
  absent, a bundled equivalent is used. Install via `pip install django-icv-search[icv-core]`
- `django.contrib.auth` — `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` FK on `SearchQueryLog` (nullable)

## Consumed By
All consuming projects needing search. No other `icv-*` packages depend on
icv-search — consuming projects wire search into their own domains.

## Specs & Docs
- APP spec: `docs/specs/APP-013-search/README.md`
- Sub-feature specs: `docs/specs/APP-013-search/features/` (FEAT-001 through FEAT-012)

## Current Status
v0.8.0 — 1219 tests passing. Three bundled backends: Meilisearch (default),
PostgreSQL (zero-infrastructure), and Dummy (testing). Four additional backends
are planned (OpenSearch, Solr, Typesense, Vespa — each as an optional SDK extra).
Full merchandising pipeline implemented. Search intelligence includes click
tracking, demand signal extraction, query clustering, and auto-synonym suggestion.

## Conventions Specific to This App

- **Settings are namespaced `ICV_SEARCH_*`** — all package settings carry this
  prefix; see the settings reference in the APP-013 spec.
- **Backend is swappable via `ICV_SEARCH_BACKEND`** — the dotted-path setting
  follows Django's cache/email backend pattern. Never hard-code a backend class.
- **Merchandising is opt-in** — models and the pipeline are only active when
  `ICV_SEARCH_MERCHANDISING_ENABLED = True` and migrations have been run. Do not
  assume merchandising tables exist unless the setting is confirmed.
- **Multi-tenancy via `ICV_SEARCH_TENANT_PREFIX_FUNC`** — a configurable callable
  returns a per-request tenant string prepended to index names. Single-tenant
  deployments leave this empty; the app must not assume either mode.
- **icv-core is optional** — the `models/base.py` module resolves `BaseModel`
  at import time: icv-core's `BaseModel` if installed, otherwise the bundled
  fallback. Do not import `icv_core.models` directly from within this package.
- **Auto-indexing via signal wiring, not `SearchableMixin` alone** — the
  `ICV_SEARCH_AUTO_INDEX` dict drives signal registration in `auto_index.py`;
  `SearchableMixin` declares the index mapping on the model but does not connect
  signals itself.
- **Async indexing requires Celery** — `ICV_SEARCH_ASYNC_INDEXING = True`
  (default) dispatches indexing operations as Celery tasks. The package falls back
  to synchronous indexing when Celery is unavailable; tests should use the Dummy
  backend or `skip_index_update()` to avoid hard Celery dependencies.
